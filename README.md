Implementing VISCA over IP into Chataigne

Disclaimer: I have no idea what I am doing.

I want to create a module for Chataigne that will be able to control cameras that support the VISCA over IP protocol.  Follow me on this journey as I try and figure it out.

In the meantime, check out [this noisette file](https://github.com/seanmcnally98/visca-for-chataigne/releases/tag/releases) that I made, which does all the functions I want my eventual module to do.  Depending on what your goal is, this may be everything you need.!
